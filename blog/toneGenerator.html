                I recently built a tone generator—my first real dive into making my own JSFX plugin. It's a fundamental exercise, but it proves the core concept behind all digital sound: simulation.

            <p>
                I recently built a tone generator — my first real dive into making my own **JSFX plugin**. It’s kind of like a VST, but different — written in REAPER’s built-in scripting language for audio effects.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A **tone generator** is simple in concept: it’s a type of **oscillator**. If you’re unfamiliar with that term, just think of something that repeats in cycles — kind of like a pulse or a wave.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 1: User Input — Picking a Note (MIDI)</h2>
            
            <p>
                First, the user picks a note using a slider. This note is in **MIDI format**, which is just a number between 0 and 127 — for example, 60 is Middle C, 69 is A4, etc. But MIDI numbers aren’t in Hertz (the unit we use for frequency), so we’ll need to **convert** that.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2: Convert MIDI to Frequency (Hertz)</h2>

            <p>
                To turn that MIDI note into a real pitch, we use a simple formula. It says: Take **440 Hz** (which is the pitch of A4), and shift it up or down based on how far away the MIDI number is from 69.
            </p>
            
           <div class="my-6 text-center">
             <img src="../myImages/midiToFreqeuncy.png" alt="MIDI to Frequency Conversion Formula" class="w-full max-w-sm mx-auto">
            </div>

            <p>
                So for example, if the user selects MIDI note 60 (C4), the formula figures out what pitch that really is — in this case, about **261.63 Hz**. That’s the actual speed of vibration we want for our tone.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 3: Calculate Rotation Speed (Angular Velocity)</h2>
            
            <p>
                Now that we know the frequency, we calculate how fast our waveform should move forward — this is called **angular velocity ($\omega$)**. It just tells us how quickly we spin through a full wave cycle (like a circle).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We calculate it using this formula:
            </p>

          <div class="my-6 text-center">
    <img src="../myImages/omega.png" alt="Angular Velocity Formula" class="w-full max-w-sm mx-auto">
</div>

            <p>
                This calculation lets us figure out how much to move forward each time we process a tiny chunk of audio (called a **sample**). Most systems process about **44,100 samples per second**.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Step 4: Keep Track of Where We Are — Phase</h2>
            
            <p>
                To know what part of the wave we’re at, we use a variable called **phase**. Think of it like a pointer moving around a circle.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Every single sample, we move the phase forward just a little bit by adding the angular velocity:
            </p>
            
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <code>phase += omega;</code>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is kind of like simulating time passing in very small steps — you’re adding a tiny amount every moment, which adds up over time.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 5: Create the Sound</h2>
            
            <p>
                Finally, we take the current **phase** and pass it into a sine function:
            </p>
            
            <div class="code-snippet">
                <code>output = sin(phase);</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                That gives us a smooth wave — and that’s the sound! The faster we spin through the wave (higher frequency), the higher the pitch.
            </p>
            
            <h2>So What’s Really Happening?</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The user picks a note</li>
                <li>We figure out how fast that note vibrates</li>
                <li>We simulate that vibration by looping through samples</li>
                <li>And we create the wave by calculating points on a circle (a sine wave)</li>
            </ul>

                    It sounds like a lot, but it’s really just a few numbers being added together over and over again — and that’s how digital sound is made!
